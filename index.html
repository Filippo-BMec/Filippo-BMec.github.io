                <p class="abstract"> Cultural and creative production (CCP) can create, renovate, and shape places' socio‚Äêeconomic environments. 
                Recent contributions suggest that culture can activate a set of cognitive and productive mechanisms that form the basis of human capital (HC) dynamics. 
                Bridging these two streams of research, the present paper investigates possible causal relationships between CCP and HC at the regional level. 
                Empirically, we used measures of employment in the cultural and creative sectors as proxies for CCP and applied generalized method of moments (GMM) panel estimations to yearly data from 283 European NUTS 2 regions from 2014 to 2020. 
                The findings suggest that CCP positively affects regions' average levels of HC even controlling for several economic and demographic factors.

                <strong>Is aging in the regional labor market wiping out localized external economies? Evidence from European manufacturing</strong>, 
                <p> <em>Minor revisions with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dKOlftYAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao" target="_blank">Amir Maghssudipour</a></em></p>
            <p class="abstract"> Aging affects workers' productivity following an inverted U-shaped relationship. However, the adverse
            effects of an aging population can be offset by endogenous technological adaptations at the aggregate
            level. Despite this, we know little about the intricate relationships operating at the regional level between
            aging, localized external economies and their effects on productivity. To fill this gap, we rely on data about
            manufacturing firms across eight European countries at the Nuts-2 level and adopt an instrumental
            variable approach to deal with residual endogeneity. Our findings indicate that while the impact of aging
            on productivity is positive, localized external effects on productivity disappear when the proportion of the
            workforce in the older age bracket reaches 19.68% for specialization economies and 24.28% for
            urbanization economies.</p>

                <strong>Firm size and local multipliers</strong>, 1st Chapter of the PhD Thesis
            <p class="abstract"> When a new establishment in tradable sectors enters a local market, it potentially creates additional jobs in non-tradable sectors.  
                If market size or cost-linkage effects offset the negative effect of increased local competition, the effect of entry is to generate additional jobs in non-tradable sector. 
                We document that the three effects change according to the size of the firm entering the tradable sector.
                The relevance of the local multipliers are assessed using a dataset on Italian local labor market areas for the period 2012-2020.   
                Using these data, our contribution to the literature is twofold. 
                First, we review and replicate previous studies and find that they are driven by the instrumental variables used and their construction.
                Second, we show that the impact of the entry of tradable establishments on non-tradable jobs is a function of their size.  
                The results indicate that small establishments generate higher relative multipliers. 
                Large establishments have the highest absolute multipliers, and the effect is driven by an increase in wages and a reduction in cost linkages.
                The entry of tradable micro firms does not generate additional jobs in non-tradable or other tradable sectors. 
                The effect of the medium firm is mainly through cost linkages. 
                The analysis is extended by introducing robust estimates for territorial heterogeneity.</p>

                <strong>Competition and external economies</strong>, 2nd Chapter of the PhD Thesis
                <p class="abstract"> As an industry expands, tasks can be divided. 
                    New specialized skills emerge, workers absorb them, and external economies in the form of knowledge spillovers are generated via labor flows between firms. 
                    While the recent empirical literature is disconnected from the tradition of economic theory, such attempts to estimate spillovers are far from unanimous.
                    This paper endeavors to bridge the theoretical and empirical literature on external economies by developing an oligopsonistic model in the local labor market.
                    The second part of the paper shows that empirics and theory can be reconciled from a methodological point of view. 
                    It then develops a two-step econometric procedure to incorporate an interaction term between competition and specialization into the traditional estimation of the effect of external economies on total factor productivity (TFP).
                    Using firm-level and confidential plant-level data for a large cross-section of Italian local labor market areas and a period of reduced local competition due to the influx of large manufacturing firms, this paper assesses the extent to which competition moderates the effect of specialization on local TFP.
                    Endogeneity concerns regarding the quality and quantity of labor and TFP due to the simultaneity of productivity shocks and input choice are also addressed. 
                    The results suggest that even in an oligopsonistic market, competition is a necessary condition to benefit from external economies.
                    There are thresholds of competition above which external economies in the labor market peter out.
                    The $HHI$ thresholds for competition range from 14.5 to 15.8.
                    Finally, there are implications for the unit of local industry analysis when considering the labor market. </p>

                <strong>Global shocks, local responses</strong>, 3rd Chapter of the PhD Thesis
            <p class="abstract"> When a global shock hits a national economy, places react differently. 
                Differences in shock responses depend on local economic structures.
                In this paper, I focus on the role of local input-output linkages in the manufacturing sector in responding to crises.  
                I use a dataset on Italian local labor market areas covering the period 2006-2022 to assess differences in unemployment responses to common shocks.
                I use national input-output tables as well as confidential plant-level data to proxy cross-sectional variation in local manufacturing input-output flows.
                Using shocks due to the financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, I assess the additional effect of a local IO linkages on unemployment rates.
                After partialling-out the role of manufacturing specialization, which is highly sensitive to global demand, if a residual effect is found, it depends on the additional effect propagating through the input-output network. 
                Taking advantage of a DiD setting, I find that LMAs with strong manufacturing input-output linkages suffer a 4\% higher increase in unemployment relative to LMAs with weak IO.

                <strong>Agglomeration and social innovations</strong> </a> 
                <p><em>with</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bgTFVCcAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao" target="_blank">Roberto Dellisanti</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dKOlftYAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao" target="_blank">Amir Maghssudipour</a></p> 
                <p class="abstract">Like patents, social innovation shows a tendency towards agglomeration. 
                While previous literature argues that it is more likely to emerge in rural areas where there are more unmet social needs, this paper documents that social innovation is mostly an urban phenomenon. 
                We examine the causes of agglomeration, focusing on two main hypotheses. 
                First, social innovation is a by-product of historical human capital investment; accordingly, it emerges in the same knowledge domain of the regional traditional specialization. Second, it is the density that fosters social innovation via information spillovers. 
                The critical mass required for social innovation is easier to achieve in cities than in rural areas because information spillovers are more frequent.
                Using the ESID-RISIS dataset, we exploit two-way fixed effects and instrumental variables to find that density is the most important factor for the emergence of social innovation. 
                Our result indicates that an increase in density of about 1,200 inhabitants (1 standard deviation) per square kilometer generates an increase of 1.85 social innovation projects. 
                We find no evidence of a relationship between historical human capital investment and social innovation.</p>
